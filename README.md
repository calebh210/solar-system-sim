# calebharmon.net - three.js-based Physics Simulator

The goal of this project is to create a Solar System physics simulator in javascript. 
The simulator will have the capability to view all the current planets, fly around in a spaceship at different speeds to view the planets, 
and add/remove masses from the system to view how it changes the gravity.
