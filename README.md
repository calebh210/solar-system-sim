# calebharmon.net - three.js-based Physics Simulator

The goal of this project is to create a Solar System physics simulator in javascript. 
The simulator will have the capability to view all the current planets, fly around in a spaceship at different speeds to view the planets, 
and add/remove masses from the system to view how it changes the gravity.

NOTE: this project was moved to https://github.com/calebh210/solar-system-sim for developement, however it will still be hosted at:
https://www.calebharmon.net/simulator
